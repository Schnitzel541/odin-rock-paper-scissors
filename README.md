What did I learn in this project?

- Learned about using different loops, even one to apply an event listener to several button elements.
- Learned more about CSS, especially how to use a media query to display content based on screen width.
- Learned about event listeners as mentioned above
- Learned how to merge with git.
- Learned how to use objects and arrays.

This was not easy, but it helped me to get somewhere I'd never thoguht I would be at.
